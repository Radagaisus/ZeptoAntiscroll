Zepto [Antiscroll](https://github.com/LearnBoost/antiscroll): cross-browser native OS X Lion scrollbars

This is a port of Antiscroll that's written in CoffeeScript, to work with Zepto. It's deprecated and you should not use it.

The best scrolling implementation out there (and believe me, I've tried them all) is [iscroll(https://github.com/cubiq/iscroll).
