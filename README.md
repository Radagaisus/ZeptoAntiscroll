# Zepto [Antiscroll](https://github.com/LearnBoost/antiscroll): cross-browser native OSX Lion scrollbars

This is a port of Antiscroll, written in Coffee Script, to work with Zepto. This is for a personal project, but it might help someone out there. Just be ready to dive in and fix a few things. Zepto doesn't have a `mouseenter` event.

Tested on:

- Google Chrome
- Firefox 12
